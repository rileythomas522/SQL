#For this project I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. 
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into. 
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#What are the top 5 most popular songs and who sings them?
SELECT track_name,
popularity,
artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC 
LIMIT 5; 

#What artist has the most songs on the list and what is their most popular song?
SELECT (artist_name), COUNT(*) as Artist_Count, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY artist_name DESC 
LIMIT 1;

#What is the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track?
SELECT
artist_name,
track_name,
avg(popularity),
avg(danceability),
avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;
